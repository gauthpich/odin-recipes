    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This ratatouille recipe is my version of the terrific French vegetable stew made with fresh tomatoes and lots of
        summer vegetables. It's very versatile side dish and makes a delicious vegetarian main dish, too.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Garlic and oil: This flavorful ratatouille recipe starts with fresh garlic cooked in olive oil. </li>
        <li>Produce: You’ll need an eggplant, two zucchini, two tomatoes, fresh mushrooms, an onion, and a red or green
            bell pepper. </li>
        <li>Seasonings: Season the ratatouille with dried parsley and salt.</li>
        <li>Parmesan: A cup of grated Parmesan cheese takes the ratatouille’s flavor up a notch.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a skillet, cook the garlic in olive oil. Add the eggplant, parsley, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cook until the eggplant is tender, then spread the mixture in a prepared casserole dish and sprinkle with
            Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Spread the zucchini on top and sprinkle with more cheese. Continue layering according to the instructions in
            Step 3. </li>
        <li>Bake the ratatouille in the preheated oven until the vegetables are tender. </li>
    </ol>
