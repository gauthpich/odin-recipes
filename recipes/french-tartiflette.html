    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This tartiflette is a delicious French dish. An American would probably call it a potato casserole. Now that I am
        in France, I am trying to experiment for my honey's sake!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large potatoes, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>7 strips bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crème fraîche</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) round Reblochon cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat; add potatoes, then reduce heat to medium-low,
            cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain; steam dry, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. </li>
        <li> Cook bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to a plate; discard
            grease. Melt butter in the same skillet; add onions. Cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes.
            Return bacon to the skillet. Add wine; simmer until nearly evaporated. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li> Place 1/2 potatoes into the prepared dish; spread 1/2 bacon mixture over top. Layer in remaining potatoes,
            spread crème fraîche over top, then add remaining 1/2 bacon mixture. Remove and discard rind from Reblochon.
            Cut cheese into thin slices; layer evenly over top of casserole. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and slightly browned, about 15 minutes. Season with salt
            and black pepper. Serve hot. </li>
    </ol>
