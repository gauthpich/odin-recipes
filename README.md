# odin-recipes

HTML exercise with The Odin Project.
In this project, I will put to test the HTML, Git, GitHub and CLI knowledge I have already acquired up until now.
Once this project completed, I will have demonstrated that I'm able to use CLI to create depositories, to clone repositories with Git and GitHub, to create files and to synchronize it with Git.
I will also have demonstrated that I am able to create basic HTML files with paragraphs, links, images, lists, heading, etc.
